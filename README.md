# ArtSwipe.io

## Overview

### What is ArtSwipe.io?

ArtSwipe.io is an app that helps art lovers to discover the work of emerging artists and to discover current nearby gallery and museum exhibitions through a playful, Tinder-esque interface. Rather than swipe left or right on would-be dates, with ArtSwipe.io users flip through images of art that is currently on display in a gallery or museum within a given radius from the user. (The user need not be constrained just to art in their proximity; a user in Topeka, Kansas, for instance, may employ an 'explore' feature and drop a pin in Berlin and take a look at what's on display in the galleries of Augustrasse.) 

When a user swipes left indicating a lack of interest, ArtSwipe.io will show similar art with less frequency. If a user swipes right, in addition to being shown similar art with greater frequency, the user user will be shown the title of the work, the name of the artist, and the current location of the piece. If the piece is for sale, the user may also be given the option to either bid on the piece or to 'buy it now.'
